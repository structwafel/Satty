# <img src="assets/satty.svg" height="42"> Satty: Modern Screenshot Annotation.

Satty is a screenshot annotation tool inspired by [Swappy](https://github.com/jtheoof/swappy) and [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/).

![](assets/usage.gif)

Satty has been created to provide the following improvements over existing screenshot annotation tools:

- very simple and easy to understand toolset (like Swappy)
- fullscreen annotation mode and post shot cropping (like Flameshot)
- extremely smooth rendering thanks to HW acceleration (OpenGL)
- working on wlroots based compositors (Sway, Hyprland, River, ...)
- minimal, modern looking UI, thanks to GTK and Adwaita
- be a playground for new features (post window selection, post paint editing, ...)

## Install

Thanks to our package maintainers, Satty is available for many distributions on Linux and BSD:

[![Packaging status](https://repology.org/badge/vertical-allrepos/satty.svg)](https://repology.org/project/satty/versions)

### Specifics
| Distribution | Command | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gentoo | `emerge -av satty` | You need guru overlay (see [wiki](https://github.com/gabm/Satty/wiki/Gentoo-Guru)). Pending [PR](https://github.com/gentoo/gentoo/pull/33908) |
| Alpine Linux | `apk add satty` | Available in [Alpine Community](https://pkgs.alpinelinux.org/packages?name=satty&branch=edge&repo=&arch=&maintainer=) |

### Cargo

You can install satty via `cargo install satty` and `cargo binstall satty`, the latter requires [cargo-binstall](https://crates.io/crates/cargo-binstall). In that case, no manpage, LICENSE file, .Desktop file are available. But you can use the `--man` and `--license` arguments to display either.

`cargo install` and `cargo binstall` methods install satty to `$HOME/.cargo/bin`. Using rustup and/or installing distribution packages for the Rust toolchain should normally add this to the user's path. How environment variables such as path are set depends on shell, distribution, compositor/desktop environment etc. It's not really possible to anticipate every possible combination from an application perspective.

### Prebuilt Sources

You can download a prebuilt binary for x86-64 on the [Satty Releases](https://github.com/gabm/satty/releases) page.

## Usage

Start by providing a filename or a screenshot via stdin and annotate using the available tools. Save to clipboard or file when finished. Tools and Interface have been kept simple.

All configuration is done either at the config file in `XDG_CONFIG_DIR/.config/satty/config.toml` or via the command line interface. In case both are specified, the command line options always override the configuration file.

#### Size Selection <sup>0.22.0</sup>

In the bottom toolbar the size can be edited directly or by + and - buttons.
Minimum is 0.1 and maximum to 99.99.

The bindings are:
- Mouse <kbd>left-button</kbd>, <kbd>wheel</kbd> and key <kbd>up</kbd>/<kbd>down</kbd> step size is 0.1
- Holding <kbd>Shift</kbd> will switch to 0.01 step size
- Holding <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> will switch to 1.0 step size
- Mouse <kbd>middle-button</kbd> and <kbd>page up</kbd>/<kbd>page down</kbd> step size is 1.0

- <kbd>b</kbd>: Brush tool
- <kbd>i</kbd>: Line tool
- <kbd>z</kbd>: Arrow tool
- <kbd>r</kbd>: Rectangle tool
- <kbd>e</kbd>: Ellipse tool
- <kbd>t</kbd>: Text tool
- <kbd>m</kbd>: Numbered Marker tool
- <kbd>u</kbd>: Blur tool
- <kbd>g</kbd>: Highlight tool

### Tool Modifiers and Keys

Crop:
- Releasing the mouse finishes the crop. It is applied to every save and copy from then on, and stays adjustable: drag its handles, edges or interior, or drag outside of it to start a new one.
- Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+right mouse<sup>0.22.0</sup> <sup>experimental</sup> button, or use the dismiss button in the style toolbar <sup>0.22.0</sup>, to reset the crop altogether.
- <kbd>Esc</kbd> and <kbd>Enter</kbd> are not consumed by a finished crop, so they run the actions you configured for them with the crop applied. Only a drag that is still in progress is cancelled by <kbd>Esc</kbd>; in that case the event is consumed, so resetting a crop never also copies the uncropped image.

Arrow and line:
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> to make tool snap to 15° steps.

Rectangle, ellipse, blur <sup>0.22.0</sup> and highlight block mode<sup>0.22.0</sup>: 
- <kbd>Alt</kbd> to center the tool around origin.
- <kbd>Shift</kbd> to make width and high uniform - results in square resp. circle.
- Hold both to combine them.

Text:
- Press <kbd>Shift+Enter</kbd> to insert line break.
- Combine <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with <kbd>Left</kbd> or <kbd>Right</kbd> for word jump or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with <kbd>Backspace</kbd> or <kbd>Delete</kbd> for word delete.
- Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> or switch to another tool to accept input, press <kbd>Escape</kbd> to discard entered text.
- <kbd>Home</kbd> and <kbd>End</kbd> go to the start/end of current line or previous/next line if already on first/last character of line (automatic wrapping is not considered for this). <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> with <kbd>Home</kbd>/<kbd>End</kbd> jumps to start/end of text buffer.
- <kbd>Up</kbd> or <kbd>Down</kbd> to jump to previous/next line (if already on first/last line, it jumps to the start/end of text buffer). <sup>0.20.1</sup>
- Combine <kbd>Shift</kbd> with other keys to select text (e.g. `Shift+Home` to select from start of line to cursor,  <kbd>Shift+Left</kbd> to select characters before cursor,  <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Left</kbd> to select words before cursor,and so on) <sup>0.20.1</sup>
- <kbd>Double-click </kbd> to select word under cursor.Triple-click to select all text. <sup>0.20.1</sup>
- <kbd>Ctrl+A</kbd> to select all text. <sup>0.20.1</sup>
- <kbd>Ctrl+C</kbd> to copy selected text to clipboard. <sup>0.20.1</sup>
- <kbd>Ctrl+X</kbd> to cut selected text to clipboard. <sup>0.20.1</sup>
- <kbd>Ctrl+V</kbd> to paste text from clipboard. <sup>0.20.1</sup>
- <kbd>Alt+Ctrl</kbd> with <kbd>Left</kbd> or <kbd>Right</kbd> or <kbd>Up</kbd> or <kbd>Down</kbd> to move the text. Use <kbd>Alt+Ctrl+Shift</kbd> with arrow keys to nudge the text. <sup>0.20.1</sup>
- Press <kbd>Alt</kbd> to cycle the text effect: none → inverted outline → contrast outline (black/white) → drop shadow. <sup>experimental</sup> <sup>0.22.0</sup>

Marker:
- Hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> to get extra ring. <sup>0.22.0</sup>

Highlight: 
- Hold <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> to switch between block and freehand mode (default configurable, see below).
- Hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> in freehand mode for a straight 15° aligned line. Stop at some position and release and hold <kbd>Shift</kbd> again to achieve perfectly aligned turns.

### CSS

Satty ships with [minimal builtin CSS](https://github.com/Satty-org/Satty/tree/main/assets/default.css) which can be overridden by `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/satty/overrides.css`. Adwaita defaults for headerbar (`@headerbar_fg_color` and `@headerbar_bg_color`) which Satty uses <sup>0.21.0</sup> may lack transparency, here's an override example:

```css
.outer_box,
.toolbar {
    color: #000000;
    background-color: #ddddddaa;
}
```

You can discover styleable elements by using the GTK inspector with env variable `GTK_DEBUG=interactive`. Also, see [wiki](https://github.com/Satty-org/Satty/wiki/Config-examples#css-overridescss) for more examples.

### IME <sup>0.20.0</sup>

Satty supports IME via GTK with and without preediting. Please note, at this point Satty has no proper fallback font handling so the font used needs to contain the entered glyphs.

### wlroots based compositors (Sway, Wayfire, River, ...)

You can bind a key to the following command:

```sh
grim -g "$(slurp -o -r -c '#ff0000ff')" -t ppm - | satty --filename - --fullscreen --output-filename ~/Pictures/Screenshots/satty-$(date '+%Y%m%d-%H:%M:%S').png
```

Hyprland users must escape the `#` with another `#`:

```sh
grim -g "$(slurp -o -r -c '##ff0000ff')" -t ppm - | satty --filename - --fullscreen --output-filename ~/Pictures/Screenshots/satty-$(date '+%Y%m%d-%H:%M:%S').png
```

Please note we're using ppm in both examples. Compared to png, ppm is uncompressed and this can save time.

### Other examples

#### Image Resize

Satty does not provide a resize mechanism other than cropping. But you can pipe the result to other tools such as ImageMagick:

```sh
grim -g "0,0 3840x2160" -t ppm - | satty --filename - --output-filename - | convert -resize 50% - out.png
```

#### Sway mode

Add this to your ~/.config/sway/config.
It needs `grim` and `slurp`.
```sh
# screenshots
# inspiration: https://www.reddit.com/r/swaywm/comments/ghnlea/comment/fqnzxkx/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
set $satty satty -f - --initial-tool=arrow --copy-command=wl-copy --actions-on-escape="save-to-clipboard,exit" --brush-smooth-history-size=5 --disable-notifications
set $printscreen_mode 'printscreen (r:region, f:full, w:window)'
mode $printscreen_mode {
    bindsym r exec swaymsg 'mode "default"' && grim -t ppm -g "$(slurp -d)" - | $satty
    bindsym f exec swaymsg 'mode "default"' && grim -t ppm - | $satty
    bindsym w exec swaymsg 'mode "default"' && swaymsg -t get_tree | jq -r '.. | select(.focused?) | .rect | "\(.x),\(.y) \(.width)x\(.height)"' | grim -t ppm -g - - | $satty

    bindsym Return mode "default"
    bindsym Escape mode "default"
}
bindsym $mod+Shift+p mode $printscreen_mode
```
